        <h3>Surfing</h3>
        <p>But my best skill is actually in riding waves. The best wave I've ever caught was at Bolsa Chica State Beach, California. Perfect conditions, no wind, the blood moon was setting in the East, the sun started to rise in the West and a school of dolphins came bye to say hi while I was riding into the sunrise.</p>
